			My professional presence on the web. Designed to be a simple clean website with just enough style to make it interesting. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Following the KISS principle, I have opted not to use a backend for this site. Considering that this site will be updated infrequently by someone that is comfortable with editing HTML and CSS directly, 
			there would be little benefit in developing a backend for this site. A backend would have greatly expanded the required effort, and therefore cost, of developing the site. 
			Instead the site has been developed entirely using frontend technologies such as AngularJS and Bootstrap.
