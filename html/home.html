<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
My name is David Skyler McCurdy. I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in the industry. In my professional career I have worked on a variety of projects both small and large. I am experienced with a many different languages and frameworks such as C#, Javascript, AngularJS, Bootstrap, JQuery, ASP.NET, WPF, Git, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL,  and Linux. I also moonlight as a web developer where I have written multiple websites for small business and professionals. 
</p>

<p>
In my personal life I have worked on many projects of personal interest. The scope of these projects vary from video games to electronics and embedded systems. One of my current projects is the open source platform Automata. Automata is software that will turn any computer into a PLC. The core of the project is written in C++ and targets Raspberry PIs.  The Raspberry PIs communicate with Atmel AVRs, which serve as remote IO bases, over Modbus. 
</p>

<p>
Of my many talents that are a few that I would like to highlight:
<ul>
<li><b>Versatility</b> – I can move quickly from one project to the next. New languages, platforms, and technologies present no problem. I will use whatever is best suited to the job at hand.</li>
<li><b>Enthusiasm</b> – I love software engineering. It is an enthusiasm that tends to rub off on others. </li>
<li><b>Persistence</b> – Failure is not an option. Do you have a hard task, or an obscure bug? Bring it on. Need me to work 100 hours a week for the next six weeks. Done.</li>
<li><b>Project Management</b> – I stay on top of things. Do you have a large fast moving project? Perfect. I can manage and document the fine details, while still keeping the big picture in mind. </li>
<li><b>Leadership</b> – Leading a team to success is a great thrill. I love mentoring others and watching them push themselves to meet challenges that they didn't think they could meet.</li>
<li><b>Database Design</b> – I have an innate ability to quickly design databases that capture all the data in an elegant structure that lends its self to querying.</li>
</ul>
